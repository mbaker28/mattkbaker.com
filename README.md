## Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website [mattkbaker.com](https://mattkbaker.com).

It is written in `PHP` using [Symfony](https://symfony.com) components.

The front end is written in [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com) and `JavaScript` compiled with Symfony's [WebPack Encore](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore) tool.
